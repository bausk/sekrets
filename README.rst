Sekrets: Dead-Simple Secrets Management Functions for Python
============

Sekrets is a simple library that stores, loads and manages your encrypted application secrets on disk.

Sekrets uses master keys to manage your credentials, `.env` variables, and access files, breaking them up
into environment sets.

That way, you can securely share between your team members everything you need to spin up an envrionment
while only needing to control access to your master keys.

Is it production ready?

Not yet, I'm using it in my pet projects but you should use something else for now.
